# TNFRSF4 → PPP Mendelian Randomisation 
Further analysis of the apparent affect of TNFRSF4 on PPP. Here I removed 4 SNPs from the original analysis that are located in the MHC region, as this region has complex linkage disequilibrium patterns and can complicate MR analyses. I found that the TNFRSF4 → PPP relationship persisted.
