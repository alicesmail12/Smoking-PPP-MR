# Investigating Pleiotropy
`MHC-SNPs-TNFRSF4.png` highlights the 5 SNPs near the MHC region: these were seperately clumped with only one retained, in a follow-up analysis.
The heatmap `Pleiotropy-Summary-Plot.png` cross references each SNP used as an IV for TNFRSF4 with the effect these SNPs have on the other proteins assessed in step 2 of this analysis. It can be seen that 3 SNPs are highly pleiotropic, these are highlighted in `Pleiotropic-SNPs-TNFRSF4.png`.
